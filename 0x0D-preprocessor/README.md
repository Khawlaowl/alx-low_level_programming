## Tasks

### 0. Define a Constant
Create a header file named `constants.h` that defines a constant named `SIZE` with the value `1024`.

### 1. Define PI
Create a header file named `math_constants.h` that defines a constant named `PI` with the value `3.14159265359`.

### 2. Print File Name
Write a C program named `print_filename.c` that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

You are allowed to use the standard library.

### 3. Compute Absolute Value
Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` in a header file named `math_operations.h` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### 4. Compute Sum
Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` in the same `math_operations.h` header file that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
