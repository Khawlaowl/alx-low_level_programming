Task 0: What's my name**
Create a function `print_name` that takes a name and a function pointer as arguments. The function should call the provided function with the name as an argument. Implement a function `print_function` that prints the name passed to it.

**Task 1: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done**
Write a function `array_iterator` that takes an integer array, its size, and a function pointer as arguments. This function should execute the provided function on each element of the array. Create a function `print_element` that prints an integer.

**Task 2: To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities**
Implement a function `int_index` that searches for an integer in an array. It takes an integer array, its size, and a function pointer as arguments. The function should return the index of the first element for which the provided comparison function does not return 0. If no element matches or if the size is less than or equal to 0, return -1. Create a comparison function, for example, to find the index of the first even number in the array.

**Task 3: A goal is not always meant to be reached**
Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program takes two integer arguments and an operator (+, -, *, /, %). It should print the result of the operation. Handle cases where the number of arguments is wrong, the operator is invalid, or division by zero occurs. Use separate files for function prototypes, operation functions, selecting the correct operation function, and the main program.

**Task 4: Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker**
Create a program that prints the opcodes (in hexadecimal) of its own main function. The program should take the number of bytes as an argument and print the opcodes accordingly. Handle cases where the number of arguments is incorrect or negative.
