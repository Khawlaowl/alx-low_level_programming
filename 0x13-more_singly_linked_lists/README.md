Components of a Singly Linked List:
A singly linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains two parts:

Data: This part holds the actual value or data that you want to store in the linked list.
Next Pointer: This part is a reference or pointer to the next node in the list. It indicates the element that follows the current node.
Structure Definition in C:
In C, you can define a structure to represent the nodes in the singly linked list. Here's an example:

c
Copy code
struct Node {
    int data;            // Data part of the node
    struct Node* next;   // Pointer to the next node
};
Creating a Singly Linked List:
To create a singly linked list, you typically start with a head pointer, which points to the first node in the list. Initially, when the list is empty, the head pointer is set to NULL.

c
Copy code
struct Node* head = NULL;  // Initialize an empty linked list
Insertion in a Singly Linked List:
To add elements to the linked list, you can perform various insertions:

Insert at the Beginning: Create a new node, set its data and the next pointer to the current head, and update the head pointer to point to the new node.
Insert at the End: Traverse the list to find the last node, create a new node, and update the next pointer of the last node to point to the new node.
Insert at a Specific Position: Traverse the list to find the node before the desired position, create a new node, and update the next pointer of the previous node to point to the new node.
