Components of a Singly Linked List:
A singly linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains two parts:

Data: This part holds the actual value or data that you want to store in the linked list.
Next Pointer: This part is a reference or pointer to the next node in the list. It indicates the element that follows the current node.
