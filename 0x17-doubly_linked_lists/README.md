0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to both the next and the previous elements in the sequence. Unlike a singly linked list, where each element only points to the next element, a doubly linked list allows for traversal in both directions.

Each element in a doubly linked list, often called a node, contains three fields:

Data: This field holds the actual value or data of the node.
Next: This field contains a reference to the next node in the sequence.
Previous: This field contains a reference to the previous node in the sequence.
